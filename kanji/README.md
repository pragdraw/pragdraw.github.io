# KanjiVG Dataset

![samples](https://cdn.rawgit.com/hardmaru/sketch-rnn/master/example/short_kanji_sample.svg)

This directory contains a vector dataset of Kanji characters used in the machine learning experiment described in this [blog post](http://blog.otoro.net/2015/12/28/recurrent-net-dreams-up-fake-chinese-characters-in-vector-format-with-tensorflow/).  It is derived from [KanjiVG](http://kanjivg.tagaini.net/), an educational open source project for teaching people Kanji.

We have converted and simplified the original `.svg` each stroke as a short polyline sequence, and stored the data into the *stroke-3* format for training `sketch-rnn`.  The train/validation/test split sizes are 10000/600/500 respectively.
